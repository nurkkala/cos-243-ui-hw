# COS 243 User Interface Samples

This repository contains sample code for 
implementing user interfaces for a web application.

- `ui-no-vue` is a traditional "Web 1.0" interface
  that has no client-side code and uses a templating
  engine (handlebars) to render HTML pages.
  CSS styling is provided by Bootstrap.
- `ui-with-vue` updates the Sign Up page of the
  `ui-no-vue` implementation to use Vue.js to augment the
  user experience. This implementation illustrates
  the ease with which Vue can be added to an
  existing web application without having to
  rewrite the entire thing.
  This implementation also uses Bootstrap for styling.
- `ui-spa` is a full single-page application (SPA)
  that is entirely implemented with Vue components.
  In addition, this implementation uses
  Vuetify for styling. This choice 
  illustrates an alternative to the ubiquity
  of Bootstrap, but also serves as an example
  of the power of Vue custom components.
